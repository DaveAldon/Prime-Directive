# Prime-Directive

It's what you've always wanted. Finally we can find prime numbers using Lua on our iPhones! 

This project is an exploration of the Codea IDE, which allows us to develop a full application in an iOS environment using the Lua langauge.

Lua scripts are located in --> PrimeDirective.codea
